# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature converts the existing React application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) that provides native app-like experiences including offline functionality, installability, and optimized performance. The PWA will work seamlessly with the existing nginx configuration and support both admin and distributor user roles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the app on my device like a native app, so that I can access it quickly from my home screen without opening a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the app THEN the browser SHALL display an install prompt for supported browsers
2. WHEN a user installs the app THEN it SHALL appear on their device's home screen with the app icon
3. WHEN a user opens the installed app THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL have a proper app name and icon displayed in the device's app list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline or with poor network connectivity, so that I can continue using basic functionality even when my internet connection is unstable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loses internet connection THEN the app SHALL display cached pages they have previously visited
2. WHEN a user is offline THEN the app SHALL show a clear offline indicator
3. WHEN a user tries to access uncached content offline THEN the app SHALL display a helpful offline message
4. WHEN the network connection is restored THEN the app SHALL automatically sync any pending data
5. WHEN critical app assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be cached for offline access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to load quickly on subsequent visits, so that I can access my data without waiting for long loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the app for the second time THEN static assets SHALL load from cache
2. WHEN the app starts THEN it SHALL display a loading screen while initializing
3. WHEN app updates are available THEN they SHALL be downloaded in the background
4. WHEN new app versions are ready THEN the user SHALL be notified to refresh for updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin or distributor, I want to receive push notifications for important updates, so that I can stay informed about critical business events even when the app is not active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the app THEN they SHALL be prompted to allow notifications
2. WHEN important events occur THEN relevant users SHALL receive push notifications
3. WHEN a user clicks a notification THEN they SHALL be taken to the relevant page in the app
4. WHEN a user denies notifications THEN the app SHALL continue to function normally without notifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PWA to work seamlessly with the existing nginx configuration, so that deployment and routing continue to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service worker is requested THEN nginx SHALL serve it with proper no-cache headers
2. WHEN the manifest file is requested THEN it SHALL be served with appropriate headers
3. WHEN the app is accessed via different routes THEN the SPA routing SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL work both online and be handled appropriately offline

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device, I want the app to feel native and responsive, so that it provides a smooth mobile experience comparable to native apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is used on mobile THEN it SHALL have appropriate touch interactions
2. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the app SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN the app is in standalone mode THEN it SHALL handle navigation properly without browser controls
4. WHEN users interact with forms THEN mobile keyboards SHALL appear with appropriate input types

## Requirement 7: Web App Manifest Completeness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully specified manifest so that every browser can correctly display and install the PWA.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The `manifest.json` shall include:
   - `name`
   - `short_name`
   - `start_url`
   - `scope`
   - `display`
   - `background_color`
   - `theme_color`
2. The `icons` array shall cover all required sizes (72×72, 96×96, 128×128, 144×144, 192×192, 256×256, 384×384, 512×512).
3. The `orientation` field shall be set (e.g. `portrait` or `any`).
4. The manifest’s `start_url` shall include a query parameter (e.g. `?utm_source=homescreen`) to track installs.

## Requirement 8: Service‑Worker Lifecycle & Caching Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear service‑worker lifecycle management and caching rules so that updates propagate correctly and caches don’t bloat.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement cache versioning and delete old caches in the `activate` event.
2. Static assets shall use a “cache‑first” strategy with a versioned cache name.
3. Dynamic/API responses shall use a “stale‑while‑revalidate” strategy, falling back to cached JSON for offline.
4. Trigger `skipWaiting()` on new service worker and message clients to `clients.claim()` for immediate control.
5. Define cache size limits and maximum entry age to prevent uncontrolled growth.

## Requirement 9: Background Sync & Offline Data Queue

**User Story:** As a user, I want my actions (e.g. form submits) queued offline and retried when connectivity returns, so I never lose data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Queue mutating operations offline via the Background Sync API.
2. On connectivity restoration, replay queued requests in order.
3. The UI shall indicate “pending sync” status for offline actions.

---

## Requirement 10: Security & Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want to know my data and communications are secure, so I trust the PWA with sensitive information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Serve the app exclusively over HTTPS.
2. Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP), HSTS, and X‑Frame‑Options via HTTP headers.
3. Encrypt or obfuscate sensitive data stored in IndexedDB or Cache API.
4. Request only the permissions strictly needed by the app.

---

## Requirement 11: Analytics, Error Reporting & Monitoring

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want usage analytics and error logging so that we can measure adoption and fix stability issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Integrate with an analytics service (e.g. Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track installs, launches, and key events.
2. Capture service worker and runtime errors and send them to an error‑reporting service (e.g. Sentry).
3. Record offline usage metrics (e.g. number of cached pages viewed) separately from online usage.

---

## Requirement 12: iOS‑Specific PWA Support

**User Story:** As an iOS user, I want the PWA to install properly on Safari, so it behaves like on Android.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Include Apple‑specific meta tags in `<head>`:
   - `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`
   - `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`
   - `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` for each icon size
2. Provide graceful fallback when Safari ignores `manifest.json`.
3. Set launch screen color via `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`.

---

## Requirement 13: Accessibility (A11y)

**User Story:** As an assistive‑technology user, I want the PWA to meet WCAG standards so I can navigate and interact without barriers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Ensure all interactive elements have accessible labels (`aria-label`, `role`, etc.).
2. Support keyboard navigation (focus states, logical tab order).
3. Meet WCAG AA color-contrast guidelines.
4. Announce offline and install prompts via screen readers.

---

## Requirement 14: Cross‑Browser & Device Compatibility

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want the PWA tested across major browsers and device form‑factors so it degrades gracefully where features aren’t supported.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Test on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari (mobile & desktop).
2. Define fallback behavior for unsupported features (e.g. Background Sync on Safari).
3. Document a compatibility matrix.

---

## Requirement 15: Testing & Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tests to verify critical PWA behaviors so that regressions are caught early.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. E2E tests covering:
   - Install flow
   - Offline mode
   - Update notifications
2. Unit tests validating service-worker caching strategies.
3. Maintain a Lighthouse audit score ≥ 90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and PWA.
4. Run these tests in CI on every merge.
